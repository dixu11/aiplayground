# AI Playground

This Spring Boot project exposes a `/api/transcribe` endpoint for uploading a `.mp4` video and receiving subtitles generated by OpenAI Whisper.

## Configuration

1. **Obtain an OpenAI API key**
   - Create an account or sign in at <https://platform.openai.com/>.
   - Navigate to **API keys** in the user menu and create a new secret key.
   - Copy the generated key.

2. **Provide the key to the application**
   - Either export the variable before running the app:

     ```bash
     export OPENAI_API_KEY=<your-key>
     ```

   - Or edit `src/main/resources/application.properties` and set `openai.api.key`.

## Upload size limits

The application is configured to accept files up to 300 MB, but OpenAI's Whisper API only processes files up to 25 MB. Videos larger than that should be compressed or trimmed before uploading.
